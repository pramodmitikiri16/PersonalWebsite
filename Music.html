		<h3> Music </h3>

		<br>

			<p> Yes. I am a musical person as well. You may not have seen any sign of music in my Basics, because this page will tell you what connections I have to music. 



			<br><br>

				Well, like everything did, it all started in 2nd grade, where I wanted to know how to play the piano. Before I begin, I have to note an uncertainty. Yes, I had 3 teachers teach me piano, and the current teacher today is the best ever yet. <br><br>



				Overall, I have been playing the piano for about 8 years now. In the first 2 years, I had my first piano teacher, and he used to give treats and stickers if I played well. Especially, he gave these cool ribbons saying, "Well Done!", "You Did a Great Job!", "Amazing Work!", and etc. I used have so much that eventually, my first piano teacher said that I didn't need anymore since I had so much in the end. It was nice to play the piano and be rewarded for it, but technically, it was not really piano at all. All I had was the keyboard, and that was okay. <br><br> 



				Soon later, I had my next piano teacher who was a good teacher and had the right idea for me. For the teacher, my parents bought 10 books. In this case for this piano teacher, it was not really playing at all. Instead, it was mostly 50% theory and 50% actual playing. From this, I was able to learn a couple of the music concepts while having this teacher. He, honestly, really helped me get my basic learning I should have gotten when I was with my first piano teacher. What was also quite helpful was the fact that he introduced me to actual pieces made by famous composers I knew about. In the end, my second piano teacher was better than my first piano teacher, and I was able to learn a lot from him. <br><br>



				Eventually, I had my third piano teacher. He is a great person who was evident in the arts of the piano. He taught me the rest of what was needed to learn, which was everything in that manner. In fact, when I first met him for the first time, I was scared, but after hundreds of lesssons, I was able to learn quickly and be better at piano than I thought I would be. What about the theory? Well for the theory, my third piano teacher just gave extra pieces that taught me it myself. Honestly, they were really helpful, and I am thankful to have such great piano teachers. <br><br>



				<h4> My Other Music </h4> <br><br>



				In addition to piano, I was also into violin too, where I played for 3 years straight from 3rd grade to 5th grade. <br>

				I played the triangle to as well. <br>

				I had little experience on the drums since some of my friends are drummers, and they taught me how to play the drums. <br>

				That, is basically it though. <br>
