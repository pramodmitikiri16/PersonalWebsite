		<h3> Welcome to My Site! </h3>
			<p>Hey everyone! My name is Pramod Mitikiri. So, in this website, there will be content consisting of my life. More specifically, it would recall on my childhood: being in elementary school, middle school, and currently high school. It would also pertain to some of my personality, such as my hobbies. However, it is all fun and games when it comes to reading my fun times and my incidents as well. That is all I have: Enjoy my website! </p>

		<h4> The Basics </h4>
			<p> Every great man always has a beginning. And for me, that beginning happened when I was born. I was born on May 20, 2002 at around 2:33 PM. I was in New York at the time, and as soon as I was born, I was invited by everyone to jump into their embrace. Honestly, it felt nice being moved around and being loved. But fast forwarding to today, I like to look back upon that moment, and to think how much love was in the air. Anyway, as of today... I am ... </p>

		<h4> Elementary School </h4>
			<p> Elementary school was adequate comparing to my experiences overall. First thing to get off... I had a horrible experience being in kindergarten. My kindergarten teacher was horrible. For private matters, that teacher's name would not be said here. In kindergarten, my teacher chose favorites, and unfortunately, I was not her favorite. In fact, I was apperantly "the worst kid to step foot in this school". She hated me so much, that she wanted me to be placed in the "MENTALLY INSANE" group. I completely disagreed with her, and to this very day, I could counter every reason she had with me with my many achievements. After that horrible year, my mom made me ... </p>

		<h4> Middle School </h4>
			<p> Middle school was a breezer for me and I enjoyed it. It was the time of year where I was able to pull myself together and enjoy whatever life threw at me. In 6th grade, it was a little bit awkward, but later in the year, I met more people who were like me: socially awkward, really smart, and also freaky when in their comfort one. But what was really the highlight of 6th grade was when I met my math teacher ... </p>

		<h4> High School </h4>
			<p> At this point, high school was nothing. I was everything: a nerd, a geek, a popular student, you name it. But when I walked into this high school, it was nothing like I ever seen. It was not what I was expecting at all. All but one of my friends were here from North Brunswick. Being in another school was not that really difficult, but it was the struggle of making more friends while also keeping in touch with my old friends as well. Anyway, at the beginning of the year... </p>

		<h4> Hobbies </h4>
			<p> My hobbies are NOT what people would call interesting. It does not contain any dangerous activities; I am not really into that sort of thing. I am mostly a quiet person who does not go into frantics. For example, I do not do anything that seems dangerous, such as going on roller coasters or playing with fire. On the other hand, I play the piano, and if I remember correctly, I think I have been on the piano for almost 8 years now. I also ... </p>

		<h4> Fun Times </h4>
			<p> Many fun times that I had consisted of the experiences from all 3 main parts of my life: elementary school, middle school, and high school. But, as you may know, I was not like everyone else. For example, I never had a sleep over until I was in 7th grade, and that happened by accident too! Besides that, there was a great time when I was in 8th grade, and I pulled a prank on my sister ... </p>

		<h4> Incidents </h4>
			<p> Sadly, I had many accidents, and I was pretty embarassed by each and everyone of them. In fact, one of my worst incidents was in 5th grade when it was time to vote who was what for the school. I got a role for "School Spirit", where I had to decide what the school wanted and how should they represent it. At the time, I was a bit timid, and I had no idea of how to do business with others. What was also at the time was Hurricane Sandy, which ... </p>
